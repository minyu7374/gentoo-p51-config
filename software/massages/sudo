 * Messages for package app-admin/sudo-1.9.2:

 * 
 * sudo uses the /etc/ldap.conf.sudo file for ldap configuration.
 * 
 * To use the -A (askpass) option, you need to install a compatible
 * password program from the following list. Starred packages will
 * automatically register for the use with sudo (but will not force
 * the -A option):
 * 
 *  [*] net-misc/ssh-askpass-fullscreen
 *      net-misc/x11-ssh-askpass
 * 
 * You can override the choice by setting the SUDO_ASKPASS environmnent
 * variable to the program you want to use.
